A bash script to send to designers so that they can get started quickly with some modern front-end build techniques.

The script downloads the following:

* Homebrew
* Node.js (via Homebrew)
* NPM
* Grunt
* Gulp

> Note that this script assumes the end user is running Mac OSX and that `which bash` returns `/bin/bash`

## Usage

```shell
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kylesuss/nodesigner/master/nodesigner.sh | bash
```
